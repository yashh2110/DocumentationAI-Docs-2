**Enter Your Topic:&#x20;**\
Simply type what you want to write about. Be as specific as possible for better results.

**Include Your Target Keyword:&#x20;**\
If you know the main keyword you want to rank for, mention it right away. This helps the agent understand your SEO goals from the start.

## 2: Confirm Your Article Settings

Before diving into research, the agent needs to confirm a few important details to optimize your article properly.

**Article Type Selection:&#x20;**\
The agent will suggest the best article type based on your topic, but you can choose what works best:

| Blog Post/Narrative | General informational content        | "Complete guide to remote work"    |
| Listicle            | "Top 10" or "Best of" style articles | "15 best project management tools" |
| How-to Guide        | Step-by-step instructional content   | "How to set up Google Analytics"   |
| Comparison          | Side-by-side product analysis        | "Shopify vs WooCommerce"           |
| Alternatives Guide  | Options and recommendations          | "Slack alternatives for teams"     |
| Review Article      | Product or service evaluations       | "HubSpot review and pricing"       |

## 3: Keyword Research & Selection

This is where the magic happens. The agent conducts deep research to understand what you need to rank.

Articles currently ranking in top 10 positions

What makes them successful

Content gaps you can exploit

<Callout uid="7412d7d9-2549-4e83-9559-724bafcdd041" kind="warning" collapsed="false">
  Choosing the right competitors is critical. Select articles that truly represent what you want to compete with, not just any top-ranking content.
</Callout>

**Deep Research Mode:&#x20;**&#x54;he agent now goes into research mode, analyzing search patterns and user intent, content structures that rank well, trending topics and questions, and semantic keywords and entities to build a comprehensive understanding of what your content needs to succeed.

### **Secondary Keywords**
